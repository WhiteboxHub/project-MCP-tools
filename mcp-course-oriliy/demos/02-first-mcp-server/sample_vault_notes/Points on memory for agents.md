## Point 1
ðŸ“Œ Memory in applications should be application-specific for optimal performance and differentiation.

ðŸ’¬ [0:00:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JTL0yp85FsE&t=30s):
> "memory is that it needs to be really application specific it needs to be specific to what you're trying to do and what things you might want to remember because that's what's going to make your application better"

## Point 2
ðŸ“Œ Short-term memory is managed through checkpoints within threads using various techniques such as message filtering and summarization.

ðŸ’¬ [0:01:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JTL0yp85FsE&t=71s):
> "checkpoints maintain memory for a specific thread a thread is equivalent to a conversation and so this is what we call short-term memory and checkpoints are the lingraph implementation for implementing that"

## Point 3
ðŸ“Œ Long-term memory includes two approaches: updating within the application logic (hot path) or conducting updates in the background.

ðŸ’¬ [0:02:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JTL0yp85FsE&t=170s):
> "one is what we call in the hot path and so this is where the application logic itself updates memory the other is when it happens in the background and so here you have the application running and there's a separate process that in the background runs and updates memory"

## Point 4
ðŸ“Œ Long-term memory implementation requires careful planning of memory structure, such as instructions or profiles.

ðŸ’¬ [0:04:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JTL0yp85FsE&t=265s):
> "for long-term memory it's really important to think about what's the exact shape of the memory that's your storing and there's a few different options that we see people doing one common type of memory is instructions"

## Point 5
ðŸ“Œ Effective memory management in applications involves customizing tools based on application needs rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.

ðŸ’¬ [0:06:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JTL0yp85FsE&t=376s):
> "we think it's a key part of building personalized and differentiated applications but we also think that there's no Silver Bullet single answer fits-all solution for memory"
