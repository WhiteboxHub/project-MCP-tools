# Quick Summary
The paper introduces the 50%-task-completion time horizon to measure AI’s ability to complete long tasks relative to human performance, showing that AI task completion time horizons have doubled every ~7 months since 2019, reaching ~50 minutes for frontier models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, with progress driven by better logical reasoning, tool use, and error correction, but still struggling with messy, unstructured tasks, and extrapolating trends suggests AI could autonomously complete month-long software tasks by 2028-2031, though real-world applicability remains uncertain.
# Bites
- [[critique of this 50% horizon time metric]]
- The study introduces “50%-task-completion time horizon”, which measures the time humans take to complete tasks that AI models can achieve with 50% success. This metric provides a clearer way to track AI’s increasing capability compared to human expertise.
- Current frontier AI models (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet) have a 50% time horizon of ~50 minutes.
- • AI progress in handling long tasks is driven by improved reliability, error correction, logical reasoning, and tool use.
- • RE-Bench, HCAST, and Software Atomic Actions (SWAA), covering 170 tasks with varying difficulty levels. ML/coding/cyber security/general reasoning
- The 50% success rate time horizon has grown exponentially (Figure 1). AI models’ success rates correlate with human task duration, with a higher chance of success on shorter tasks.
- Persistent Weaknesses: • AI still struggles with messier, unstructured tasks. 
- Performance drops in dynamic environments where feedback is unclear.
- • “Messiness” factors (e.g., resource limitations, novelty, real-time constraints) negatively affect AI performance, but improvement trends remain consistent
- If the trend continues, AI systems could autonomously complete month-long software tasks by 2028-2031.
- Key factors influencing future progress: Agency training (making models more proactive). Compute scaling (hardware and algorithmic improvements). • Automation of AI R&D (AI improving itself).
