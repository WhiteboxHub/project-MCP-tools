Effective AI agents require structured boundaries between human language and machine execution: convert natural language to structured tool calls, maintain full control over prompts and context windows, treat tools as JSON outputs your code interprets, and unify your execution state with the LLM's interaction history. Design agents to be pausable and resumable through simple APIs, enable human intervention via structured tool calls when needed, and maintain explicit control flow rather than blind looping. Handle errors by compacting them into context for model recovery, keep agents small and focused on specific tasks, make them triggerable from any interface, and architect them as stateless reducers where input plus history deterministically produces the next action. Pre-fetch anticipated context to optimize performance and reduce token overhead.

This synthesis emphasizes the core theme: building production-ready agents requires clear separation of concerns between language understanding and code execution, with robust state management and human oversight capabilities.
