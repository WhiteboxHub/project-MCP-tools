# My Reading Journey

I've been an avid reader since I was young, and I wanted to share some of my favorite books that have shaped my perspective over the years. My number 1 favorite book of all time is: "Ethics a Nichomacea by Aristotle"

## Fiction Favorites
* "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig - This book really made me think about the choices we make in life and how they shape our reality. The concept of infinite possibilities was mind-bending!
* "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir - I couldn't put this down! The friendship between Rocky and Grace was unexpected and heartwarming.
* "Klara and the Sun" by Kazuo Ishiguro - Such a beautiful exploration of what it means to be human, told from the perspective of an AI.

## Non-Fiction Gems
* "Atomic Habits" by James Clear - This book completely changed how I approach building new habits. The 1% better every day concept is so powerful.
* "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari - A fascinating journey through human history that made me see our species in a whole new light.
* "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel - Changed my relationship with money and helped me understand why we make the financial decisions we do.

## Recent Reads
